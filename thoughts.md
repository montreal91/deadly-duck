# Thoughts 

### 1. _After 10 seasons in my game, I don't want to play it anymore. Why?_
**First of all**, the game became repetitive. I'm doing the same things over and over again and again.
The process of building good players is not very complicated and quickly becomes tedious.
There are too few interesting decisions to make.

**Second**, there are not many strategies to employ.
Once one discovers the optimal strategy, there's nothing left to explore and, everything but optimal is almost doomed to fail.

**Third**, the simple strategy I've implemented for rudimentary AI works incredibly well, the best player can do is to match it, not overcome it.
And since several AIs play optimal strategy, it's extremely unlikely to win the cup. 
The game becomes just gambling, and not a test of wits, which I intend it to be.

**Verdict:** The current game system is too simplistic, and doesn't provide enough room for maneuver.
Simplicity is good, but oversimplification makes things dull and not exciting.
